unicode-haskell.vim - beautifies Haskell source code using Unicode characters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

'unicode-haskell.vim' is a simple Vim script which will improve the way
Haskell source code is displayed in Vim/GVim by replacing certain character
sequences with appropriate Unicode replacements. The Unicode characters
are not written to disk but only used for display.

of what Unicode characters this script uses in the editor.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply copy the 'unicode-haskell.vim' file into the 'ftplugin/haskell'
subdirectory of your vim configuration folder; that would be
'$HOME/.vimrc/ftplugin/haskell' on Mac OS/X and Linux and
'%HOME%\vimfiles\ftplugin\haskell' on Windows.

Furthermore, the filetype plugin must be turned on so that vim picks up
this script and you should set the encoding to UTF-8 so that all the
fancy characters are actually displayed Just add

 filetype plugin on
 set encoding=utf-8

to your '.vimrc' or '.gvimrc' file.

Finally, make sure that you use 'gvim' with a Unicode font. On Mac OSX
the font DejaVu Sans Mono works very well. Add

 if has("gui_running")
   set guifont=DejaVu_Sans_Mono:h9
 endif

to your '.vimrc' to use it.
